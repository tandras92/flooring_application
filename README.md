# Goal
* create a CRUD application that can be used to read and write flooring orders for SWC Corp.
  
  The application will have a configuration (app.config) file with an appSettings key to set the mode to either Test or Prod. If the mode is Test, then the application should provide sample data and allow the console user to read order information. This data should not be saved between runs of the application. If the mode is Prod, then the application should read and write order information from a file.
